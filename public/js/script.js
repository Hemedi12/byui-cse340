// public/js/script.js - Clear or simplify this file
// As per the MVC pattern with server-side routing for navigation,
// the client-side JavaScript for handling categories/sections based on hashes
// is no longer necessary for primary navigation.
// You can remove its content or keep it minimal if you intend to use it
// for other client-side functionalities not related to navigation.

// For this specific request, let's simplify it as it conflicts with server-side nav.
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    // This script can be used for other client-side interactions if needed.
    // For navigation via server-side routes, this file's prior content is not needed.
